# fireflyFx

The complexity of some problems are often difficult to manage with classical algorithms because they require a lot of steps or even can not be implemented, for which intelligent algorithms and techniques, each for a specific type of problem are used. In this paper we develop a solution for problems crypto arithmetic type using the technique of bio-inspired algorithms, more precisely algorithms based on the behavior of fireflies.

# Paper about the solution

[Xin-She Yang - Firefly Algorithm: Recent Advances and Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3898.pdf)

# About the development

For this work we used the next tools:
* NetBeans 8.1
* Java for the library
* JavaFX with SceneBuilder for GUI

# Verbal arithmetic
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithmetic, cryptarithm or word addition, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. The name can be extended to puzzles that use non-alphabetic symbols instead of letters.

The equation is typically a basic operation of arithmetic, such as addition, multiplication, or division. The classic example, published in the July 1924 issue of Strand Magazine by Henry Dudeney, is:

The solution to this puzzle is O = 0, M = 1, Y = 2, E = 5, N = 6, D = 7, R = 8, and S = 9.
